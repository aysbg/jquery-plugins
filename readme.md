###jQuery plugin for custom select menu

Its a very simple plugin that I created in order to avoid the issue of having different styling for select element in different browsers.
Only html that you need to write is the standard select>options and add 'data-header' attribute to opening select tag.
CSS is provided.
JS to invoke the plugin: $('select').customSelect({ minWidth: 125, listWidth: 150 });

That's about it... have fun.
